# Security Policy

[🇩🇪 Deutsche Version](SECURITY.de.md)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| `main` | ✅ |
| `0.1.x` | ✅ |
| `< 0.1` | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report privately via a
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/malkreide/amtsblatt-mcp/security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue.

Include if possible: affected version, reproduction steps, the tool call or
request involved, and the impact you observed.

## Response Targets

- Acknowledgement: 5 working days
- Initial triage: 10 working days

## Scope

**In scope:** the published package, the Docker image, the GitHub workflows,
the green allow-list enforcement, the egress allow-list, and the SSE auth and
rate-limit middleware.

**Out of scope:** the behaviour of amtsblattportal.ch itself; forks with the
allow-list or authentication removed; findings in dependencies without a
demonstrated impact on this server.

## Data-protection findings are security findings

A defect that lets a blocked rubric be queried — or that leaks content from a
blocked rubric into a response — is a **vulnerability**, not a bug report.
Please use the private advisory channel for it. Concretely, report any of:

- A rubric outside `GREEN_RUBRICS` reaching the upstream query string.
- `get_publication` rendering content from a rubric that is not green.
- A tool signature accepting a person-identifying parameter.
- A refusal message that discloses a circumvention.

## Hardening Notes for Operators

1. **Put a gateway in front of the SSE transport.** The built-in bearer auth and
   rate limit are single-instance only; the rate-limit buckets are held in
   process memory and are not shared or garbage-collected across instances.
2. **Restrict egress at the network layer too.** `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a
   defence-in-depth measure inside the process, not a substitute for an egress
   firewall. Note that setting it *replaces* the default entirely — it must
   include `amtsblattportal.ch`.
3. **Rotate `MCP_API_KEY`** and never bake it into an image.
4. **Ship the JSON logs to your SIEM** and alert on `auth_failed`,
   `rate_limited`, `egress_denied`, `green_gate_violation` and
   `blocked_publication_requested`. The last two mean something tried to reach a
   rubric the server does not serve.
5. **Do not persist responses.** Publications carry statutory deletion periods;
   the server deliberately keeps no content cache, and downstream storage would
   undo that.
